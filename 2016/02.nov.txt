Why we need training? Because interest and passion are not sliver bullet.
The education or training can be the best way to make us get our achievement even without the interest and passion.
You are professional, that is your capabality whatever in a new or old area, whenever you are suffering from the continuous frustration. So that we can continuously change or evolove.
