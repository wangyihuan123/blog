Well, the truth is that people choose c instead of c++ mostly based on emotion, not ration.
The speaker spent almost half an hour explain the social behavious effect and something like philosophy. Not sure wherther or not it is about phychology.

All the talking is going to express that C++ is also a high performance embedded friendly language.

Yes, another topic is also talk about the performance.


Anyway, I'm doing the right thing. Sometimes, 祸兮福所倚，福兮祸所伏。So, I'm super Ben.

At least, today, I have learn about the t-test and t value from the assignment and also talk with DonDon about the IT and our personality which I beleive it benefit both Dondon and me.

Again, there is nothing right or wrong choice, but how do you face it. From today, yes, I also began to control my breath to control my temper. This is definite a very good start. Thanks, Manish, you help me a lot. I would keep annoy you, sorry about that.

Now, I realize that what I learn from Gloria and Michel is their spirit of 严谨而扎实. They do not want to skip some essential process. They do the basic thing can benefit it a lot! Yes, this education change me quite a lot.Keep doing, you are getting better and better!

Well Done, today. Not bad at all.
