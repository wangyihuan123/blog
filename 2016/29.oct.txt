Catherine离开的第五天，The day Denny left.


3.00 woke up again, because of the anxiousness
4.00 got up and went to Denny's house
6.00 got back home with Don and continue the sleeping

11.30 finish shopping, keys copying, gps support choosing and  arrived at Denny's house again
12.30 finished packing and cleanning
13.45 finished lunch
15.00 finished packing and clean of our staff
15.30 moved to new homestay
17.30 finished driving coaching and neighbour discovery and Don sent me home
18.30 searched the solution for new gps support, actually finally understand the usage of this support and the market in China and US
19.00 caicai gave a good solution in a short time and all done!
20.00 finished dinner
21.30 spent half an hour to solve caicai's bluetooth problem, it turned out that troubleshooting and update driver and then restart pc can solve this. Restart!
22.00 recording all these to warm up

23.00 the vpn, hma still cannot work, but at least, now I can login and try to connect
23.30 airmail problem ==> turned out that the problem is because web page order issue
0.00 emacs's with email seems not that fancy, decide to keep using the current airmail 2. This is enough. There are a lot of feature I even haven't used.

todo: report hma!!

so, after 22.00, too tired, all shit work!
